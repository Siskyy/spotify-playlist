## Description

An React app build using the above languages.
This app uses the spotify API to allow the user to search for songs from the Spotify database.
Users can also add the songs to a local playlist object to make a playlist of multiple songs.
Then using their connected spotify account, the user can add this playlist to their spotify account, directly from the application.

The UI for this app is inspired by the spotify UI.
The app background is from [FireWatch](https://www.firewatchgame.com/)

### Challenges:

- Spotify API
  - getting to learn the spoitfy web API and implementing it into the project took the majority of the time. This is one of my first projects learning to use fetch methods, aswell as an API.
